## Challenges

### Guess the Number

#### 🔍 Problem Statement

Write a function that challenges users to guess a randomly chosen number between 1 and 100.

#### 💡 Considerations

- You have 7 attempts to guess the number correctly.
- After each guess, the program will tell you if your guess is too high, too low, or you guessed the number.
- The game only ends when the number was guessed correctly or run out of attempts.
